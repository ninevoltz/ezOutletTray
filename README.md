# ezOutletTray
A little application that lives in the system tray that lets you turn the [ezOutlet5](https://msnswitch.com/portfolio-items/ezoutlet5/) on and off from your desktop using the RESTful API.

ezOutlet5 contains an ESP32-WROOM-32 module with Wifi and Ethernet connectivity. The board has headers for UART, bootloader, and reset. JTAG could be connected with some work, like removing the LEDs and adding a JTAG header.

It appears to be very hacker friendly if you are so inclined.
